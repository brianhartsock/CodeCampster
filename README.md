# CodeCampster

This is a simple NHibernate tutorial I wrote for a Code Camp talk.  It was written for a 2010 talk so it may be slightly outdated.

## .help files

The tutorial is meant to be a live code excercise.  The .help files represent a working implementation, in case something went awry while doing the tutorial.
